Q2)What are data types in Javascript? Explain the different types of data types with examples.

JavaScript has two categories of data types:

    Primitive Data Types (Immutable, stored by value)
    Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types (Mutable, stored by reference)

    1. Primitive Data Types

Primitive types are stored directly in memory and compared by value.
(a) Number

Represents both integers and floating-point numbers.
let age = 25;    
console.log(typeof age);

(b) String

A sequence of characters enclosed in single (' '), double (" "), or backticks (` ` for template literals).
et name = "John Doe";
console.log(typeof name); // Output: "string"

(c) Boolean

Represents true or false values, mainly used in conditional logic.
(d) Undefined

A variable declared but not assigned any value.

2. Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types

These types are stored by reference, meaning they donâ€™t hold actual values but rather a reference to memory.
(a) Object

Used to store key-value pairs.

let person = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 30,
    isStudent: false
};
console.log(typeof person); // Output: "object"

(b) Array

A special type of object that stores ordered values.
let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango"];
console.log(typeof fruits); // Output: "object"
